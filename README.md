# Data Analysis
## Pre-Assessment Quiz

Before we dive into the topics covered in this module, it's important to evaluate your current understanding of AP Statistics. Take this pre-assessment quiz to gauge your knowledge and pinpoint areas where you may need to focus your study.

Once you've completed the quiz, review your results and identify the topics where you scored the lowest. Concentrate on these topics during the rest of the module.

In the Pre-Assessment Quiz, you will be asked a series of multiple-choice questions that cover a range of topics in AP Statistics. The quiz is designed to help you evaluate your current knowledge and identify areas where you may need to focus your study. Once you've completed the quiz, you will be able to review your results and see which topics you need to work on. This will help you get the most out of the rest of the module and be better prepared for future studies in AP Statistics.
